The mission
-----------
The mission of this tutorial is to provide users a walk through Symfony and help them with a real-world example to learn developing business valuable, good quality and easily maintainable software.

It is a continuation of the original Jobeet Tutorial, initially created for Symfony 1.x in the early days of this framework.

On creating this piece of software, the founders had in mind the curricula for Symfony Certification and tried to cover all topics required for a developer to pass the exam.
